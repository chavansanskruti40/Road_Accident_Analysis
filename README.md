### Project Overview

Every year, thousands of road accidents occur due to various factors like weather conditions, road surfaces, vehicle types, and location-based risks. This project is an interactive Tableau dashboard designed to analyze and visualize road accident data to uncover critical insights.

By leveraging data visualization, this dashboard helps identify accident trends, severity levels, and key contributing factors. The goal is to provide a data-driven approach to improving road safety.


### Dataset Details

The dataset includes:

✔ Total number of accidents (yearly breakdown) 

✔ Casualty count categorized as fatal, serious, or slight

✔ Accident locations (geographical coordinates)

✔ Vehicle types involved in accidents

✔ Weather conditions during the accident

✔ Road surface type (dry, wet, icy, etc.)


### Tools 

- Excel - Data Cleaning
- Tableau- Creating Dashboards, Data Visualization


### Insights

🔹 Accident Statistics & Trends:

- Total Accidents & Casualties – Track year-over-year (YoY) accident trends.

- Fatal, Serious, and Slight Casualties – Breakdown of accident severity over time.

- Sparklines for Visual Trends – Quick trend analysis for different severity levels.


🚗 Impact of Vehicle Types:

- Analyze how different vehicle types contribute to accident fatalities.
  
- Breakdown includes trucks, motorcycles, bicycles, cars, and pedestrians.
  
- Compare trends across multiple years to see any improvements or worsening conditions.

  
☁️ Weather & Road Surface Conditions:

- Weather Influence: Check how rain, fog, and other conditions affect accidents.
  
- Road Surface Analysis: Compare accidents on wet, dry, icy, or frosty roads.
  
- Fatality Rates by Condition: Identify which conditions result in the most severe accidents.

  
🛣️ Road Type & Location Analysis:

- Accidents by Road Type: Find out if single carriageways, dual carriageways, roundabouts, or slip roads have higher accident rates.

- Geographical Mapping: View accident hotspots with an interactive location-based heatmap.


📌 Key Performance Indicators (KPIs):

- YoY changes in total and fatal casualties (with % increase/decrease).
  
- Fatalities per vehicle type and road condition.
  
- Comparison of accident severity over different periods.



### How To Use

1️⃣ Download and open the Tableau workbook or import the dataset into Tableau Public/Desktop.

2️⃣ Explore the interactive dashboard to visualize accident trends and patterns.

3️⃣ Use filters (Year, Severity) to compare different conditions and insights.

4️⃣ Analyze specific accident factors to derive conclusions for improving road safety.



### Why This Project Matters

Road safety is a global concern. Understanding why and where accidents occur can help:

✅ Traffic authorities design safer roadways.

✅ Policymakers enforce better driving laws.

✅ Drivers & pedestrians become more aware of risky conditions.

✅ Data analysts leverage insights for further studies.


This project provides actionable insights that can be used for research, policy decisions, and road safety improvements.
